## About Me

I'm a data-driven thinker who loves solving real-world problems with code and statistics.  
Currently diving deep into machine learning, predictive modeling, and data storytelling. I work with Python, R, and SQL, and I enjoy building clean, scalable ML pipelines.

🔍 I care about:
- Model fairness and evaluation beyond just accuracy (F1 Score, AUC, etc.)
- Making data insights interpretable and impactful
- Learning something new every single day

## Tech & Tools
